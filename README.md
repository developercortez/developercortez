            <h1>Hello !!!</h1>
            <br>
             <p><strong>I love tecnology </strong> and learn every day more about this beautifull field. 
               I especialized in UI/UX, Html, Css and JavaScript. 
               but also know a lot of Adobe, React, Angular, Fluter and other software programs. 
               <br> 
               I live in Paris and once I was a professional athlete with good results.

               After my athlete carrier I became a professional culinary chef. I worked in many countries
               for the best organizations in the world and Michelin Star restaurants. I have a chef website
               where I post videos and photos of easy recipes that anybody can cook at home:

               <br>
               I speak fluent English, Spanish and French and I like to work with people with diferent backgrounds.
               I can provide solutions by my own but I prefer to work in teams to accomplish stuning results. 
               I like to spend time with my girlfriend, videos, surfing, code, books and food.
               It would be a pleasure to meet you soon and if we work together even better!
               Thanks for sharing with me :)
